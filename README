Only works on firefox

This is a greasemonkey script which executes whenever you visit a site.

This script autofills username field to adi.sriku366 which you can modify after installing the script. To do that first install greasemonkey plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 and then click on the autofiller.user.js

Once you install goto Tools->GreaseMonkey->ManageScripts . Click on edit autofiller and add your username in place of adi.sriku366
